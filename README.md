# Srtd: AI-Powered File Organization

## Inspiration

In today's digital age, students face the challenge of managing vast amounts of educational content spread across devices. According to FileMaker Inc., **50% of students lack a unified system to manage academic materials, and 87% believe better organization would improve their grades.** Srtd was created to solve this problem, leveraging AI to intelligently organize and locate relevant files, allowing students to focus on learning and achieving academic success.

### Process
1. **File Analysis:** Srtd accesses the file system and processes files into structured objects.
2. **AI Integration:** Files are analyzed using OpenAI's API to generate summaries, extract key information, and create embeddings.
3. **Organization Logic:**
   - Fuzzy matching identifies similarities between files.
   - AI embeddings group files based on content context.
4. **User Interface:** A GUI displays:
   - Original and suggested file locations.
   - Confidence scores for organizational decisions.
   - File summaries for easy understanding.
5. **User Confirmation:** After user review, Srtd organizes files based on approved suggestions.
